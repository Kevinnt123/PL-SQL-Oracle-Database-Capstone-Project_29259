# 📋 What’s This Project About? 🤔
This project is a Supplier Payment and Delivery Monitoring System built with an Oracle database and PL/SQL. It automates the tracking of supplier orders, delivery dates, and payment schedules. The system automatically flags delayed shipments and overdue payments using database triggers and procedures. It also generates performance reports to help businesses identify reliable suppliers. The goal is to eliminate manual errors, ensure timely payments, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

# PHASE I: Problem Statement & Presentation

# 1. Problem definition

•	Late Delivery 😣: A key supplier's shipment is late, but no one knows until it's already a problem. This stops production and hurts customer trust, all because of manual tracking.

•	Payment Confusion 💸: Finance gets an invoice, but is it for a delivered order? Is it even overdue? Without a clear system, payments get delayed, and suppliers get frustrated.

•	No Supplier Report Card 🔍: Is Supplier A always on time? Is Supplier B often late? There's no easy way to track performance, so it's hard to know who your reliable partners are.


# 2. Context: how the system will be used

This system is designed for use by a company's Procurement and Finance departments. It acts as a central, automated platform to manage all interactions with suppliers. It helps track orders from the moment they are placed until the final payment is made, ensuring everything runs smoothly and on time.

# 3. Target Users: 

•	**Procurement Officers:** Places orders with suppliers.

•	**Finance Officer:** Processes payments to suppliers after delivery.

•	**Supply Chain Manager:** Monitors overall supplier performance.

# 4. Our goals:
